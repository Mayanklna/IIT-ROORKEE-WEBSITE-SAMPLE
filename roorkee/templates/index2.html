An alumni association is an association of graduates or, more broadly, of former students (alumni). In the United Kingdom and the United States, alumni of universities, colleges, schools (especially independent schools), fraternities, and sororities often form groups with alumni from the same organization. These associations often organize social events, publish newsletters or magazines, and raise funds for the organization. Many provide a variety of benefits and services that help alumni maintain connections to their educational institution and fellow graduates. In the US, most associations do not require its members to be an alumnus of a university to enjoy membership and privileges.

Additionally, such groups often support new alumni, and provide a forum to form new friendships and business relationships with people of similar background.

Alumni associations are mainly organized around universities or departments of universities, but may also be organized among students that studied in a certain country. In the past, they were often considered to be the university's or school's old boy society (or old boys network). Today, alumni associations involve graduates of all age groups and demographics.

Alumni associations are often organized into chapters by city, region, or country.

My experience at AIMS Bangalore was very different and has led me to explore and learn new things in terms of personal and professional aspects. The faculty at AIMS focus on students' career goals with proper guidance in selecting most suitable specialization based on one's strengths and passion. The pre-placements activities were highly effective for us to have a clear idea on facing interviews. The various co-curricular activities built confidence and leadership skills in us. Attending the National Level Fest was a major experience, which helped me understand my potential and overcome my insecurities. The ambience of the college has always been so positive and encourages to learn.
